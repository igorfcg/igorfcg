## 📚 Development Principles

I’m committed to writing high-quality code guided by these core principles:

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD):** I focus on modeling software around the business domain to ensure it aligns with real-world needs.
- **SOLID Principles:** I design code that’s modular, extensible, and easy to maintain.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** I write tests first to validate functionality and minimize bugs.
- **Clean Architecture:** I structure my projects to separate concerns, making them reusable and adaptable.

## 🤝 Approach to Development

My development process is all about clarity and efficiency:

1. **Understand:** I dive deep into the problem and requirements.
2. **Plan:** I design a scalable solution with architecture in mind.
3. **Build:** I implement using best practices and my guiding principles.
4. **Test & Refine:** I rigorously test and iterate to deliver a polished product.

I love collaborating with teams, sharing ideas, and tackling challenges together.
